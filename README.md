# TunnelGen

> **NOTE:** I'm abandoning this project because I spent a lot of time on it and couldn't get it to work, and the value it would provide (for me) is a lot less than I would get out of it. However, if anyone else wants to pick this up and make it work feel free!

The concept here is to get the Visual Studio Dev Tunnel URL from your API and automatically use it in another project. I have tried using T4 templates with some success, and the source generators also work with some success, but both approaches require specific MSBuild tasks and are not really portable or reusable, or reliable.
